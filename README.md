## The Big Idea

Examining health industry data sets to explore the relation between covid-19 cases, population density, and mask usage by US county

### Data Sets Used
US County Populations Data Set: https://covid19.census.gov/datasets/21843f238cbb46b08615fc53e19e0daf/data?geometry=136.810%2C28.795%2C-136.179%2C67.148

US COVID Cases By County Data Set: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/live

US Mask Use By County Data Set: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use

### Results

Exploratory data analysis of these public data sets reveals no strong correlation between mask usage and covid-19 rates per unit population as well as no strong correlation between population density and covid-19 rates per unit population. However, these data sets do show a correlation between population density and mask usage, suggesting that it is most likely the case that densely populated areas are taking more precautions to fight covid-19 and thus have similar infection rates when compared to sparsely populated areas.
